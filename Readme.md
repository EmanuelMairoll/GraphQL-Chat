## GraphQL-Chat

This is a small demo application experimenting with the library [kgraphql](https://kgraphql.io), a GraphQL-Implementation written in Kotlin.

You can query and search for Contact Information, Query and Modify User Data (given the right, definitely not hardcoded Auth-Token), read and post messages into chats etc.

It runs on top of the Ktor-Framework and the netty-Webserver.
